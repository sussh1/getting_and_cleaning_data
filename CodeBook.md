## The Code Book

The variables in the tidy data are:

Time domain signals came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals and were captured at 50Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise:
